# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to refactor HTML and CSS elements to meet accessibility standards so that the site is search engine optimized. HTML elements were replaced by Semantic HTML elements. Some repetitive CSS rules were condensed and put in logical order. The images have alt attributes now and a concise title was chosen.
